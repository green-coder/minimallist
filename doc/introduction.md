## Introduction

Minimallist is a minimalist data driven data model library.

It tries to address some of the usability problems of [Clojure Spec](https://clojure.org/guides/spec)
while being data-driven, similarly to [Malli](https://github.com/metosin/malli) but differently.

The name `Minimallist` was chosen from the words `minimalist` and `malli`, in honor to the `Malli` project.
`Minimallist` is not related to `Malli`, its implementation and design choices are different.

There is a [#minimallist](https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/C012HUX1VPC) channel in Clojurians Slack for discussion & help.
