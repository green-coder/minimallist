A minimalist data driven data model library.

It tries to address some of the usability problems of [Clojure Spec](https://clojure.org/guides/spec)
while being data-driven, similarly to [Malli](https://github.com/metosin/malli) but still quite differently.

The name `Minimallist` was chosen from the words `minimalist` and `malli`, in honor to the `Malli` project.
`Minimallist` is not related to `Malli`, its implementation is from scratch and its design choices are different.
